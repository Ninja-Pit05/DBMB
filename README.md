# DBMB 2.1
The main repository for the development of Droneboi Map Bot.

**Droneboi Map Bot**, or **DBMB**, is a discord tool for the mobile game series [Droneboi: Conquest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rizenplanet.droneboiconquest) by [Rizen Planet Studios](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7611018448877408213).

## Goal
DBMB's main functionality is to be a quick, intuitive and easy way to check in-game faction territory to Droneboi Discord community, and also convey tools in a convenient and easy way to the Ccmmunity. Like siege pings, siege analysis, faction leaderboard, market info and others.

## Main principles
***Usability first.*** DBMB should focus on bringing useful tools to the community.
***From the community to the community.*** The bot is meant to be used by the Droneboi community, so the community can suggest, ask, help to code and review new and old bot functionalities.
***Python.*** Kind of obvious, but since the bot is in python, everything should be written in python.
***All server rules also apply.*** The bot, as the server and the game itself, should be safe for kids to use.
