# DBMB 2.1
The main repository for the development of Droneboi Map Bot.

**Droneboi Map Bot**, or **DBMB**, is a discord tool for the mobile game series [Droneboi: Conquest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rizenplanet.droneboiconquest) by [Rizen Planet Studios](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7611018448877408213).

## Goal
DBMB's main functionality is to be a quick, intuitive and easy way to check in-game faction territory to Droneboi Discord community, and also convey tools in a convenient and easy way to the Ccmmunity. Like siege pings, siege analysis, faction leaderboard, market info and others.

## Main principles
- ***Usability first.*** DBMB should focus on bringing useful tools to the community.
- ***From the community to the community.*** The bot is meant to be used by the Droneboi community, so the community can suggest, ask, help to code and review new and old bot functionalities.
- ***Python.*** Kind of obvious, but since the bot is in python, everything should be written in python.
- ***All server rules also apply.*** The bot, as the server and the game itself, should be safe for kids to use.

# Development
Discussion about the bot can be made on [#general-dbmb](https://discord.gg/EKaZ8R4Re)  and [#dev](https://discord.gg/eSzzaMtUV).
Suggestions can be made through the `//feedback` command and will be displayed on the `#suggestions` channel in our discord server.

Those who don't know how to code but want to help with the bot can do so by testing the bot, finding bugs/errors, fixing grammar (i fail at those a lot), suggesting new content or improvements.
